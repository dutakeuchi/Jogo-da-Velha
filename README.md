üïπÔ∏è Tic Tac Toe game developed in Python.
I'm a beginner Python student so my code definitely still needs a lot of improvement.

So far, you can choose your opponent's difficulty level.
Each number represents a position on the board and it's filled with either your character or opponent's character.
The player who gets three in a row - vertically, horizontally or diagonally - wins.
